### What is it?
It's a GUI framework for Unity that aims to keep things as simple as possible while keeping draw calls to an absolute minimum. I am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project <a href="http://mrzapp.github.io/vongott/">The Vongott Chronicles</a>

### Version 1.0
The upcoming version of OpenGUI will deprecate the use of OnGUI draw calls and move towards the low-level GL API. It's well under way, but still in the works. If you want to test it out, check out the "testing" project in this repo.

### Why?
The reason for making this is that I don't have the patience to sit around and wait for the upcoming UI engine (and I don't know whether I'll even want to use it or not), and I find the UI frameworks in the Asset Store bloated and/or expensive. This is a fat-free open source alternative, for those of you who might be interested in that.

### How to use it?
You can use the editor menu to add widgets or just create empty game objects and add components manually.
The draw order, scale and position of the widget classes are inherited from the game object's transform component.

### Features
- Drawing 2D & 3D GUI in edit mode (in game view)
- Supports most regular widget types, plus a few odd ones
